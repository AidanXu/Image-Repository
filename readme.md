# Project

This project was built with [ExpressJs](https://github.com/expressjs/express).

## Dependancies

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Development server

Download with `git clone https://github.com/AidanXu/Image-Repository.git`. Navigate to the folder `Image-Repository` and run `npm install` to install and update dependancies. Run `nodemon app.js` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` to use the application. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. To use the application, follow the instructions in the SwaggerUI to upload, search for, and delete images.

## Note

I added the config files with the secret keys in the end because it would have been too complicated to include a file from another location.
